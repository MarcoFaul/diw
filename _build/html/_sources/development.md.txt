Development
==================================

### To use the global binary and point to your local installation

1. Install diw via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). [Go here](https://diw-tool.netlify.app/installation.html)

2. Clone & install the [Repository](https://github.com/MarcoFaul/diw)

3. Go to the local installed git repository directory and run the following command: 

        make symlink-dev
        
``` note::
    This will create a symlink between the `diw` binary and your local git repository
```

### Submitting a PR

Please use the make commands to format test und build local docs 
and check if everything works as expected
