Installation
==================================

### Prerequisites

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
* [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) (for some commands)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (for some cases)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (Git ofc)

### Installing via Homebrew

DIW can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on both macOS and Linux hosts.
This will add a new brew tab and installs a global `diw` binary/executable:

    brew install marcofaul/diw/diw
    
Now just run:

    diw
